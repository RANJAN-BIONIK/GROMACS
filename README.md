A biotechnologist by training, aspiring Computational biologist and Al/ML enthusiast.

This is my project for masters dissertation: 
Understanding the antimicrobial resistance mechanism of alanine racemase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis against Cycloserine.

The codes in this project were already present in some GitHub pages, i integrated those GitHub pages with some my tweeks to create a Workflow from Protein Prediction to molecular dynamics simulation.
